# Symptom-Assesment-Interface
This is a project completed in HCI class Spring 2019 designing an interface for patients to assess their pain

The assessment ideally is taken on a tablet while sitting in the waiting room to check in.
The "Pain Assessment" portion of the interface with the body is ideally able to be clicked on and will highlight the specific body part when hovering. When clicked it will fill in the text box underneath that also may be otherwise filled in if the body part is not clear from the image. These features and more will be available in upcoming production.
