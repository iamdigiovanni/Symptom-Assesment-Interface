# Symptom-Assesment-Interface
This is a project completed in HCI class Spring 2019 designing an interface for patients to assess their pain

The assessment ideally is taken on a tablet while sitting in the waiting room to check in.
The "Pain Assessment" portion of the interface with the body imaging is ideally able to be rotatable/clicked on and will highlight the specific body part when hovering. When clicked it will fill in the text box underneath that also may also be otherwise filled in by the user if the body part is not clear from the image. These features and more will be available in future versions.

We also were assigned a very similar project where a patient check in portal was designed according to specific guidelines. 
I will post a screenshot of it below but similar to the previous interface, it was really our first look at designing user interfaces in general using visual studio and there is nothing going on in the backend, meaning when you click a button nothing happens. In my next upload on github I will show an android application designed in the same class where there is actual working code.
